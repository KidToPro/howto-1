Title:	Your clients can change content but not design

## The most amazing ways for your clients to update their site ##

Telegram offers the most amazing ways for your clients to update their site
without bothering you, without knowing any passwords, without logging into a web site,
and without breaking your design.

### Update by Dropbox ###

You can [share a Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/help/19/en) with your client
and define how the content in the shared folder gets places on the web site. For example:

* Clients can add pictures to the site by saving pictures into the shared folder and
  the pictures get populated into a gallery on the site.
* Clients can post restaurant menus by saving files in the shared folder and the
  site gets updated with the latest menu at midnight the day the menu become available
  (so the restaurant owner can do 2 weeks of menus at once) and you can even have
  a PDF of menu emailed when it goes live (so it can be printed).


### Update by Email ###

Clients can post content to the site by sending email to a unique address (and you can have
lots of addresses so you can have lots of different users).

* Make a blog post by email
* Add a new picture to an art gallery web site by emailing the picture and a description of the piece
* Add a school event like a parent's meeting by emailing a description of the event
* Add a new real estate listing by emailing pictures and a description of the property

And all email updates go back to the same site files that you own and control so
the client can email an update and then change the content by editing a file in the
shared Dropbox folder.

### Updates are safe ###

Any updates your clients make to the site can only change content, not design.
That way, you don't have to worry about a client messing up the site by changing
the wrong file.

### No passwords required ###

And there are no shared passwords required. No new accounts required (except a Dropbox
account, but they have almost 100 million users so there's a good chance your client
is one of them.)


## Restaurant Example ##

You can build a site for the owner of a local bistro. You can build a nice Html5 site that
works super-well on mobile devices as well as larger screens (we at Telegram love
[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).)

Your client can put a week's worth of menus in a shared Dropbox folder. They can author
the menus with Microsoft Word or whatever app they like using. The menus will appear
on the site the day they become valid and a PDF of the menu will be emailed to
the restaurant manager so they can print it out.

Your client is happy because they have control. You're happy because you spend time
doing what you do best, designing web sites, rather than copy/pasting menus into a clunky
web-based CMS system. Plus, you get to charge your client for the feature of giving them
more control over their site.


## Real Estate Example ##

Listing a property on a real estate web site is as easy as taking a few pictures on
a mobile phone, emailing those pictures with a description of the property to a special
email address and the real estate agent's web site is updating automatically with the
new listing.

But the workflow can be more elaborate. Perhaps the listing gets put in a "drafts"
folder and the office manager gets an email when the listing is in the drafts folder.
The office manager reviews and edits the listing and then move the files from the
drafts folder to the published folder and the listing goes live.

All easy. All with tools the agents and the manager know. All without passwords or
web interfaces.

## Gallery Example ##

You're putting together a web site for an art gallery. The gallery owner knows art, but
isn't, perhaps, overly skilled with computers.

The gallery owner can add new listings to the gallery web site by taking pictures of the 
new art work and emailing the pictures and description to a special Telegram email address.
The listing will be posted automatically on the gallery web site and the
listing information and pictures will be put in a shared Dropbox folder for subsequent
editing or removal.

The gallery owner can update the content on his site easily. He never has to call you
because he forgot the CMS password. You don't have to be in the business of
posting for him. Just give him the email address to post to and share a Dropbox
folder with him and he's got control of the stuff on his site that he's an expert with.
