title:	Utility Pricing

## Utility Pricing ##

You pay for Telegram just like you pay for electricity… by the amount you use.

## Free during alpha testing ##

We're currently alpha testing Telegram and during the alpha period, you pay
nothing to use Telegram.

## Pricing Structure ##

Basic Telegram pricing is like electricity, except it's based on bytes.

### Credits

We credit your account $25 when you open it.

Each month, we top your account up with $1 if it's below $25.

### Base Charges

We charge $2 per month per gigabyte to store the bytes that make up your site (the site itself and a copy of the repository with the raw content).

We charge $2 per gigabyte for data served.

### Extra charges ###

There will be extra charges for the following:

* Servers in other geographies. By default, your site will be served out of Virginia, US. If you
  want redundancy or your content to be served out of Europe, Asia, or the western US,
  you pay more.
* One site that accesses multiple closed repositories. If you're a designer that delegates
  certain content to your client's Dropbox folders, we're going to charge you… but you
  can pass along the costs.
* There will be other add-on services (like [Dexy](http://dexy.it) integration) that will cost more.

## What it all means ##

If you're a blogger with a site that gets 10,000 page views a day, you're likely going to pay
nothing. If you're a high volume site, you're likely going to pay less per month
than you would to host your own content.

## Special love for open source and non-profits

If you're a non-profit or open source project, we will work with you to make things fit your 
budget.
