title:	Your files are yours, always

## Your files are yours, always ##

With Telegram you always have the files that make up your web site. This is a huge win.

## Edit on the go

You can edit your site on the go without having to worry about an Internet connect,
a web site reloading, getting logged out of a content management system because you
went to lunch while drafting, remembering yet another password or
any of the other frustrations with web-based content management systems.

## You own your stuff, you control your stuff ##

Your files are yours. Your content is yours. Take it with you. Move it to another service without
_exporting_ or _using APIs_ or other barriers to moving on. Even our [legal stuff](https://telegr.am/legal)
makes it clear that Telegram is like a laundry service or a car parkâ€¦ 
you always own your stuff, we just service it.

## Based on open source ##

Telegram uses [Hoisted](http://hoisted.org) to convert your files into your web site. You can
do this yourself, too. You can set up a machine to host the resulting HTML files and all that
stuff. Telegram just makes it a lot easier. So, if you ever decide to move on, you can do
it and there are no proprietary systems to block you. There are no hidden magic pieces
that only Telegram has. You can make your site work anywhere just like it works on
Telegram's servers.
